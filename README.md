# bmi-currency_calcualtors
This is a simple website I created for a college project. The site was first written in jQuery, but later switched to Vue. The site is in Polish and has two main tools: one to help you find out your Body Mass Index (BMI), and another to help you convert money from PLN to another currency using NBP (National Bank of Poland) API.
